    "# Task 4 : Strings : \n",
    "\n",
    "A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in single ('), double (\"), or triple (''' \"\"\") quotes. It is used to store text-based data, such as words, sentences, or symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points About Strings:**\n",
    "- Strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).\n",
    "- They can be enclosed in single (' '), double (\" \"), or triple (''' ''' or \"\"\" \"\"\") quotes.\n",
    "- Strings are indexed (each character has a position).\n",
    "- They support various operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- upper()      : Converts all characters to `uppercase`\n",
    "- lower()      : Converts all characters to `lowercase`\n",
    "- title()      : Capitalizes first letter of each word\n",
    "- capitalize() : Capitalizes the first letter of the string\n",

    "# Task 5 :Some other Data Types List,Tuples,Dictionaries and Sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists:** A list is an ordered collection of elements, which can be modified (mutable). It allows duplicate values and different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ```\n",
    "    # my_list = [1, 2, 3, \"Sourabh\", 3.5, True]  # List with mixed data types. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Tuples:** A tuple is like a list but immutable (cannot be changed after creation). It is faster than lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionaries:** A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs. It is used for fast lookups and requires unique keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sets:** A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for removing duplicates and performing set operations.\n",
